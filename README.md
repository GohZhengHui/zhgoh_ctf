# Flare-On Challenge 9 (2022)

1 Oct 2022 0800 â€“ 12 Nov 2022 0900

This CTF was introduced to me by one of my cyber security professor, Lam Fhong Sheng from CSA.

Challenge 1: Flaredle was relating to the then popular Wordle game where we were given a 21 letter word to guess.

Because I was still very new to CTF, I did it in a old fashioned way.

Simply by going online to search for a 21 letter word and managing to get some greens at the front allowed me to do elimination method in the list of words they provided.

Doing that secured me the word and obtaining the flag.

Challenge 2 required reverse engineering with IDA which I was jsut starting to learn in school so I couldn't complete this challenge.
