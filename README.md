# About page

Hi I am Zheng Hui, currently a Computer Engineering NTU student specializing in cyber security.

This page is used by me to keep track of my CTFs.

The events that I participated in are at the left sidebar in chronological order of latest on top to earliest at the bottom.

I only started keeping track of my CTF as of 13/2/2023 so I do not have most of the screenshots/memory of the CTF I did before that.
