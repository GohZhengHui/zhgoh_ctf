# 2022 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge & KringleCon

Duration is unknown but the writeup submission was on 6 January 2023 but I think it was still accessible even after that date. Its even accessible during the time of this writing (13/2/2022).

This CTF was introduced to me by one of my guild mates from one of my games.

I attempted this for fun since it was the holiday period and I was quite free.

This was an interesting CTF as it involved moving around with your character and interacting with the environment.

The story is split up into 5 parts with each being a ring, which I believe references Lord of the Rings.

For the first ring (Tolkien), I manage to complete the first 2 sub-challenge before getting stuck with Suricata rules.

For the second ring (Elfen), I could only solve the first one as the second one involves a container which I had no experience in.

For the third ring (Web), I could only solve the first 2 as I did not have much knowledge in networking.

For the fourth ring (Cloud), I did not even know how to start as it involves web services.

The final ring seems obtainable after you get all the other rings.

Overall, I completed 23% of the story which was not that bad in my book.



What I learned: the windows event logs gave me a lot of practice on it along with the Wireshark challenges
