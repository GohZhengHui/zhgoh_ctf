# TSIC (The InfoSecurity Challenge) 2022

26 Aug 2022 (2100H) - 11 Sep 2022 (2100H)

My first ever CTF that I participated in.

Together with my university friends, we decided to start getting exposed to capture the flag events to help us gain more experience in Cyber Security.

Due to our inexperience in this field, we sadly did not clear any challenge apart from the registration.

The participation badge is pretty cool though.

What I learned: more experience is needed x.x
